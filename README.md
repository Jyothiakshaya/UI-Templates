Welcome to my official UI-TEMPLATES repository!
This repository showcases a collection of user interface (UI) templates that I have personally designed using Figma.
Figma is a powerful, cloud-based design and prototyping tool widely used for UI/UX design. It enables real-time collaboration, making it ideal for teams and individual designers to create, test, and share interactive prototypes and design systems.
In this repository, you will find:
RESTAURANT MENU
LOGIN AND SIGN UP PAGE
MAIL TEMPLATE

Each template reflects attention to detail, modern design principles, and usability. Whether you're a developer looking for inspiration, or a designer exploring layout ideas, these templates can be a valuable resource.
Feel free to explore, give feedback, and use these templates in your own projects .
Stay tuned for regular updates with new design concepts!
